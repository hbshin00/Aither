# AitherBulb Demo

Created for the SureStart Virtual Artificial Intelligence Learning (VAIL) Makeathon in March 2021, with Vitaliy Stepanov, Kayla Lee, and Jessica He, this project is the demo for the AitherBulb, a lightbulb designed to respond to user's facial expressions, by adjusting its tint to complement the user's emotional state and adjusting its brightness in response to directional squinting, by observing the user in real-time and running the images continually through a convolutional neural network which identifies emotions. This project placed 2nd in the Makeathon.
